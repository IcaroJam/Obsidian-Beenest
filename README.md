A fork of @santiyounger 's Wasp that fits better with my personal preferences.

Changes include dynamic header font size and coloured headers with orange tones that fit the base golden yellow of the Wasp theme.

Currently dark mode only.

## Set-Up

* Either:
  * Download beenest.css, open your Obsidian's themes folder and put it there.
  * Clone this repository and create a link to beenest.css in the place mentioned above.
