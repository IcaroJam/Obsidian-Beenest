A fork of [santiyounger's Wasp](https://github.com/santiyounger/Wasp-Obsidian-Theme) that fits better with my personal preferences.

Changes include dynamic header font size and coloured headers with orange tones that fit the base golden yellow of the Wasp theme.

Currently dark mode only.

**_It really doesn't add or change much at the moment. I'll come back to it once I've learned css more or less properly._**

## Set-Up

* Either:
  * Download beenest.css, open your Obsidian's themes folder and put it there.
  * Clone this repository and create a link to beenest.css in the place mentioned above.
